Here I try to create various visualizations in D3.js.

Notes on running local server:

To run a server for D3.js (v3) from Node.js:
- open PowerShell
- navigate to the folder with your html page
- run: http-server
- open browser and go to: address of the server, e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8080

To run a server for D3.js (v5) via Python3.x:
- open PowerShell
- navigate to the folder with your html page
- run: python -m http.server 8888
- open browser and go to: address of the server:
    http://localhost:8888
